        doubts:\r\n- Global `LoadingRoute` behavior has changed (though it''s decently\r\n  agreed
        upon that it was always mad broke). Instead of creating a\r\n  top-level sibling
        view of `ApplicationView`, (sub) loading routes\r\n  render into an outlet
        (unless you override `renderTemplate` to\r\n  do otherwise). This will surprise
        avid users of `LoadingRoute`,\r\n  wherever they are. There doesn''t seem
        to be a clean way to preserve\r\n  this behavior in a backwards compatible
        manner without putting\r\n  mental/API hurdles in front of doing the likely
        more desirable\r\n  new behavior of rendering loading templates into outlets,\r\n  but
        I''m all ears.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Extend this logic to `error` routes/templates\r\n-

        PR normalizes browser inconsistencies regarding the encoded / decoded properties
        on the `window.location` object. As discussed in #3263, it force-url-decodes
        all properties prior to using them, and force-url-encodes all properties prior
        to setting them, and prior to using them for internal comparison.\r\n\r\nThe
        edge case that this PR cannot solve is the literal `%25`. Given an unknown
        browser behavior on the input being url encoded or decoded, we have no way
        of knowing, for sure, whether it means `%` (originall encoded) or `%25` (originally
        decoded). There is no behavior-sniffing method, that I know of, to check whether
        a browser would url-encode / url-decode the entry URL itself, and @wagenet
        has expressed a desire not to use browser-sniffing code in the ember code
        base with regards to this issue. ([here](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/3263#issuecomment-25736757))\r\n\r\nTests:
        none for now. The code needs review to check for expected correct API, i.e.
        where to return a url encoded/decoded strings.\r\n\r\nThis PR might also necessitate
        changes in downstream code that consumes the location api, e.g. it should
        render #3396 obsolete.\r\n\r\nThis PR *might* cause BC-breaks to apps that
        rely on some location-derived apis, e.g. the `params` hash in routes'' `model`

        is simply a counterpart of `Ember.computed.none`, in line with `Ember.computed.empty`
        having an `Ember.computed.notEmpty` counterpart.\n\nOn a side note, it is
        rather cumbersome and inconsistent to declare an inverse for these computed
        properties. Do we declare more inverses for `equal`? Or `bool`? IMO the canonical
        way of writing these should be unified, and should probably go through the
        `not` helper. One idea is to allow chaining of computed properties helpers,
        such that devs can prepend `not` in front of other helpers - much like in

        is a very incomplete pull request, but I wanted to see whether this idea was
        sensible before I fleshed out the docs / tests.\r\n\r\nI love the render helper.
        It''s great for creating reusable components, especially when working with
        routerless applications. I want `render` to be able to look up the template
        / controller name from a variable, like I can with the `view` helper. This
        will let me replace my reusable view components with a view / controller pair.\r\n\r\nHere''s
        a contrived example of how I am currently using it:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nApp.inputs
        = [\r\n  Ember.Object.create({ label: ''name'', renderTemplate: ''textfield''
        }),\r\n  Ember.Object.create({ label: ''email'', renderTemplate: ''textfield''
        }),\r\n  Ember.Object.create({ label: ''name'', renderTemplate: ''hideable''
        })\r\n];\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# application.js.handlebars\r\n{{#each input
        in App.inputs}}\r\n  {{render input.renderTemplate input}}\r\n{{/each}}\r\n\r\n#
        textfield.js.handlebars\r\n<label>{{label}}</label>\r\n{{view Ember.TextField}}\r\n\r\n#
        hideable.js.handlebars\r\n<a href=\"javascript:;\" {{action \"show\"}} />I
        want to enter a value for {{name}}</a>\r\n{{#if visible}} {{view Ember.TextField}}
        {{/if}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to ember, and I''m still
        trying to work my way around the code base, so please let me know if this
